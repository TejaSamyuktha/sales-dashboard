## SQL Queries for Analysis

### 1. Total Revenue per Year
      SELECT d.year, SUM(st.amount) AS total_revenue
      FROM sales_transactions st
      JOIN date d ON st.order_date = d.date
      GROUP BY d.year
      ORDER BY d.year;
### 2. Top 5 Markets by Revenue
     SELECT m.markets_name, SUM(st.amount) AS revenue
     FROM sales_transactions st
     JOIN markets m ON st.market_code = m.market_code
     GROUP BY m.markets_name
     ORDER BY revenue DESC
     LIMIT 5;
### 3.Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold
    SELECT p.product_type, SUM(st.sales_qty) AS total_qty
    FROM sales_transactions st
    JOIN products p ON st.product_code = p.product_code   
    GROUP BY p.product_type
    ORDER BY total_qty DESC
    LIMIT 5;
DAX Measures for Power BI
### 1.Total Revenue
            Total Revenue = SUM(sales_transactions[amount])
### 2.Total Quantity Sold
            Total Sales Qty = SUM(sales_transactions[sales_qty])






## Data Analysis

Insight:

Revenue has grown steadily from â‚¹90M in 2017 to â‚¹130M in 2020, with a peak of â‚¹145M in 2019.
Interpretation:
The business is scaling well, but the slight dip in 2020 might be due to market conditions (e.g., COVID-19 impact).
### 2. Top Performing Markets
Insight:

Delhi NCR is the most profitable market contributing ~52% of total revenue, followed by Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
Interpretation:
These Tier-1 markets are revenue drivers. Consider expansion or retention strategies here.

Interpretation:
These categories could benefit from targeted promotions and stocking priorities.
### 4. Monthly Seasonality in Sales

Interpretation:
These periods can be leveraged with promotions, combo offers, or bundled pricing.
### 5. ðŸ§­ Zone-Wise Distribution
